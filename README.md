# Getting Started with Create React App

I started by creating the app and remove and add the essential items.

## initialize React Router

I needed to make it basic at first so I only added the name of the pages and up until now everythings work good.
There was something I faced in this part which was I'd made the router in the App component so I thought throughout this project the App component is gonna be bigger and it's not a good parctice in the future so I moved the Router inside the Index component.

## finish with Home page

finish with the basics of the styling and the logic of Home page.
there were some issues here where I needed to make the router inside a nav so I made a component to it.

## create the table where all of our data are gonna end there

I started with the only the styling before adding the API to make sure that I'm gonna only work on it.
I added a varible changes whenever the size of the screen changes so I can display only data fits the screen and I'm satisfied with the results so far.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
