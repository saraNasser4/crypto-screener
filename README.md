# Getting Started with Create React App

I started by creating the app and remove and add the essential items.

## initialize React Router

I needed to make it basic at first so I only added the name of the pages and up until now everythings work good.
There was something I faced in this part which was I'd made the router in the App component so I thought throughout this project the App component is gonna be bigger and it's not a good parctice in the future so I moved the Router inside the Index component.

## finish with Home page

finish with the basics of the styling and the logic of Home page.
there were some issues here where I needed to make the router inside a nav so I made a component to it.

## create the table where all of our data are gonna end there

I started with the only the styling before adding the API to make sure that I'm gonna only work on it.
I added a varible changes whenever the size of the screen changes so I can display only data fits the screen and I'm satisfied with the results so far.

## Add coingecko api

I put the data from that API in separate component just to make sure that I can access to it in whatever part in this project and wrap it on the Home component.
I displayed the data in the screen and everything works perfact up until now there only one thing I need to add which is change the format from the data depends on the type of it.

## Formating the data 

I needed to make the data looks stylish and change the style depends on what kind of data we render.

## Style Filter section

I wanted to make a search bar and sorting input so I can access my data more easliy up until now I only add the style there's no logic.
